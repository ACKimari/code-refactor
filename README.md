# code-refactor

## ðŸ—£ Description
This is a project that allowed me to understand the basic and complex elements of a website. A website that can be viewed from any screen-size and still be pleasing to the eye. My motivation was being able to input correct codes with the right structure from our classes. I may have resolved a few but every success counts and for a start I can say I know more than I did from the start of this course.

Moreover, this project solves repetition and a clean look for all screen-sizes. Its components were already well developed, however the structure and process initiated was not so great. Therefore, I learned that over-coding is not necessary as there are cleaner and simpler structures to execute. I also learned the beauty of adjusting a website to fit all screen-sizes!

Finally, I may have not been successful in this challenge but I have definitely learned a lot!
